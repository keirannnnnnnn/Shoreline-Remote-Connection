### Key Technologies
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: Modern Windows desktop UI framework
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of UI and business logic
- **Data Binding**: Reactive UI updates
- **JSON Persistence**: Local storage of connection data

## Customization

### Styling
The application uses a comprehensive styling system defined in `App.xaml`:
- **Color Palette**: Windows Copilot inspired colors
- **Modern Controls**: Custom button, textbox, and card styles
- **Liquid Glass Effects**: Subtle gradients and shadow effects

### Adding VNC Libraries
To add actual VNC connectivity, you can integrate libraries such as:
- **VncSharp**: Open-source .NET VNC client library
- **TightVNC .NET**: Commercial VNC components
- **RemoteViewing**: Modern .NET VNC implementation

The VNC viewer window is already set up with placeholders for VNC control integration.

## Development Notes

### VNC Integration
The current implementation includes:
- ‚úÖ UI framework and design
- ‚úÖ Connection management
- ‚úÖ Persistence layer
- ‚ö†Ô∏è VNC protocol implementation (placeholder)

To add real VNC functionality:
1. Add a VNC client library to the project
2. Update `VNCViewerViewModel.ExecuteConnect()` to use the VNC library
3. Embed the VNC control in the `VncDisplayBorder` in `VNCViewerWindow.xaml`

### Data Storage
Connection data is stored in JSON files in the user's AppData folder:
- `%APPDATA%/VNCClient/saved_connections.json`
- `%APPDATA%/VNCClient/recent_connections.json`
